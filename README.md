<h1>ISO 27001 Internal Audit - Healthcare Organization</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

I led an ISO 27001 internal audit for a healthcare organization, assessing controls against HIPAA, GDPR, and ISO requirements. The audit identified compliance gaps in risk assessments, access controls, and incident response. I delivered a corrective action plan and audit report, strengthening the ISMS and improving patient data protection.

<h2>Challenge</h2>

The healthcare organization manages large volumes of sensitive patient data and operates under strict regulatory obligations (HIPAA, GDPR, national healthcare laws). While an Information Security Management System (ISMS) was in place, leadership required an internal audit to assess compliance maturity, identify gaps against ISO/IEC 27001 requirements, and strengthen patient data protection.

<h2>Approach</h2>

As the designated Internal Auditor, I conducted a structured ISO 27001 internal audit with a focus on high-risk healthcare domains. My methodology included:

- **Control Review** – Benchmarked existing policies and procedures against ISO 27001 Clauses 4–10 and Annex A controls.

- **Interviews & Validation** – Engaged stakeholders including IT admins, HR, compliance officers, and clinical staff to assess policy awareness and control effectiveness.

- **Risk & Control Testing** – Evaluated incident response readiness, backup recovery capabilities, and access control enforcement (segregation of duties, termination processes).

- **Evidence Gathering** – Collected and reviewed system logs, incident records, access provisioning documents, and audit trails.

- **Compliance Cross-Check** – Assessed alignment with HIPAA, GDPR, and healthcare-specific data protection requirements.

<h2>Findings </h2>

The audit revealed a mix of strengths and areas for improvement:

- **Major Non-Conformities:** Lack of a formalized risk assessment process; absence of documented access control policy.<br>
- **Minor Non-Conformities:** Incomplete user access reviews; untested incident response procedures.<br>
- **Opportunities for Improvement (OFIs):** Outdated acceptable use training materials; manual deprovisioning process.

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

I developed a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) with clear ownership and deadlines. Key actions included:

- Establishing a formal risk assessment framework aligned to Clause 6.1.2.<br>
- Automating user access termination via HR–IT integration.<br>
- Conducting quarterly tabletop incident response exercises.<br>
- Updating awareness training and AUP content with healthcare-specific examples.<br>
- Scheduling annual ISMS reviews and BCP/DRP failover tests.<br>

<h2>Outcome</h2>

The final deliverables included a detailed Internal Audit Report, Non-Conformity Register, and Corrective Action Plan, supported by an executive level risk heatmap. My findings and recommendations strengthened the ISMS by closing compliance gaps, reducing risk exposure, and enhancing resilience. This positioned the organization for improved audit readiness, stronger HIPAA/ISO 27001 compliance, and long-term patient data protection.
