<h1>Internal Audit for ISO 27001 Implementation in a Healthcare Organization</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
I led an ISO/IEC 27001 internal audit for a healthcare organization, assessing controls against HIPAA, GDPR, and ISO requirements. The audit identified compliance gaps in risk assessments, access controls, and incident response. I delivered a corrective action plan and audit report, which strengthened the ISMS and improved patient data protection.

The healthcare organization managed large volumes of sensitive patient data and operated under strict regulatory obligations (HIPAA, GDPR, and national healthcare laws). While an Information Security Management System (ISMS) was already in place, leadership required an internal audit to assess compliance maturity, identify ISO/IEC 27001 gaps, and reinforce patient data protection.

<h2>Approach</h2>

I conducted a structured ISO 27001 internal audit with a focus on high-risk healthcare domains. My methodology included:

- **Control Review** – Benchmarked existing policies and procedures against ISO 27001 Clauses 4–10 and Annex A controls.

- **Interviews & Validation** – Engaged stakeholders including IT admins, HR, compliance officers, and clinical staff to assess policy awareness and control effectiveness.

- **Risk & Control Testing** – Evaluated incident response readiness, backup recovery capabilities, and access control enforcement (segregation of duties, termination processes).

- **Evidence Gathering** – Collected and reviewed system logs, incident records, access provisioning documents, and audit trails.

- **Compliance Cross-Check** – Assessed alignment with HIPAA, GDPR, and healthcare-specific data protection requirements.

<h2>Findings </h2>

The audit revealed a mix of strengths and areas for improvement:

- Major Non-Conformities: No formalized risk assessment process; no documented access control policy.<br>
- Minor Non-Conformities: Incomplete user access reviews; untested incident response procedures.<br>
- Opportunities for Improvement (OFIs): Outdated acceptable use training materials; manual deprovisioning process.

I developed a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) with clear ownership and deadlines.

<h2>Outcome</h2>

The audit deliverables included a full Internal Audit Report, Non-Conformity Register, and Corrective Action Plan, supported by an executive-level risk heatmap. The audit closed compliance gaps, reduced risk exposure, and strengthened resilience, positioning the organization for improved HIPAA and ISO 27001 compliance and long-term patient data protection.
